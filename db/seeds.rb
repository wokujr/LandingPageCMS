# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: "Star Wars" }, { name: "Lord of the Rings" }])
#   Character.create(name: "Luke", movie: movies.first)

# Content.create(title: "Construction", body: "This body content about the construction projects")
# Content.create(title: "Ocean", body: "This body content about the Ocean Oil projects")
# Content.create(title: "Job", body: "This body content about the Job that available")
